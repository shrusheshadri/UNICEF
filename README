🌍 UNICEF Maternal & Child Health Coverage Analysis
Calculate and visualize population-weighted coverage of key maternal and newborn health indicators across countries and mortality groups.

📌 Objectives
Compute population-weighted averages for maternal & newborn health indicators using projected birth counts.
Compare performance across country groups defined by Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR).
Prepare clean data for visualizations and policy discussions.

🧮 Methodology
Indicator Extraction: Data is sourced from official UNICEF datasets.
Country Grouping: Based on Status.U5MR classification (high, moderate, low mortality).
Population-Weighted Average:
Weighted Average=∑(coverage×births)∑births
Weighted Average= ∑births / ∑(coverage×births)
​ 
Robustness: Handles missing values and zero-population entries for statistical accuracy.

⚙️ Reproducibility
user_profile.py sets up environment variables, locale, and working directory.
Code adheres to modular structure and avoids hardcoding paths.
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
Data files stored in data/ and outputs in output/.
Entire workflow can be rerun using run_project.py.
