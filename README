🌍 UNICEF Maternal & Child Health Coverage Analysis
This project calculates population-weighted averages for key maternal and newborn health indicators—antenatal care (4+ visits) and skilled birth attendance—across country groups categorized by under-five mortality rate (U5MR) status. By weighting these indicators using projected birth data, the analysis presents a more accurate reflection of coverage in high- and low-burden contexts.

📌 Objectives
📈 Compute population-weighted averages of health coverage indicators using projected birth counts.
🌐 Compare performance across U5MR-defined groups (e.g., high, moderate, low mortality burden).
📊 Prepare data for visualizations and evidence-based policy discussions.

🧮 Methodology
Indicators are extracted from UNICEF's datasets.
Countries are grouped by their Status.U5MR classification.
Weighted averages are calculated using:
Weighted Average
=
∑
(
coverage
×
births
)
∑
births
Weighted Average= 
∑births
∑(coverage×births)
​
Handles missing values and zero-population entries to ensure statistical robustness.
