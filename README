🌍 UNICEF Maternal & Child Health Coverage Analysis
Calculate and visualize population-weighted coverage of key maternal and newborn health indicators across countries and mortality groups.


📌 Objectives
Compute population-weighted averages for maternal & newborn health indicators using projected birth counts.
Compare performance across country groups defined by Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR).
Prepare clean data for visualizations and provide interpretations for policy discussions.


🧮 Methodology
Indicator Extraction: Data is sourced from official UNICEF datasets.
|            📚 Source                 |       💬 Description         |

| 📘 UNICEF Health Coverage Indicators | Maternal & newborn indicators | 
| 👶 UN World Population Prospects     | Birth projections             | 
| ⚰️ U5MR Classification               | Mortality rates by country    | 


Country Grouping: Based on Status.U5MR classification (high, moderate, low mortality).
Population-Weighted Average:
Weighted Average= ∑(coverage × births)/ ∑births
​ 

Robustness: Handles missing values and zero-population entries for statistical accuracy.

🧹 Preprocessing Steps for WPP2022_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT_REV1.xlsx 
Before analysis, the UN World Population Prospects (2022) Excel file was preprocessed to ensure clean and usable data:
Sheets Cleaned: Both relevant sheets were edited.
Header Cleanup: Unfrozen Rows to allow smooth iteration during data reads.
                Deleted Top 15 Rows, which included metadata and formatting unrelated to the tabular data.
Visual Elements Removed: UN Logo and any other embedded graphics were deleted to avoid parsing issues. The cleaned file was saved as a .csv for programmatic uses.

⚙️ Reproducibility
user_profile.py sets up environment variables, locale, and working directory.
run_project.py code adheres to modular structure and avoids hardcoding paths.
All dependencies are listed in user_profile.py
Data files stored in Raw data/ and outputs in Output/.
Entire workflow can be rerun using run_project.py.
